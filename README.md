Classical Report Events
Rahul Mehta
Classical reports are the most basic ABAP reports in which we display the output using
WRITE statement.
Event is always triggered by a specific action or a specific occurrence(when a particular
time has been reached).
â–  The example of specific actions are mouse click, pressing a key etc. The example of
specific occurrence is running out of memory etc.
